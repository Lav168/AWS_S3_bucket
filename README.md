 AWS S3 Static Website Hosting with Version Control and Rollback

 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use AWS S3 for hosting a static website with version control and rollback functionality. The website is hosted in an S3 bucket, and versioning is enabled to keep track of multiple versions of the website's files. 

 Steps
1. **Create an S3 Bucket**: Set up an S3 bucket to store the website files.
2. **Enable Versioning**: Configure versioning on the bucket to track and manage changes to files.
3. **Host Static Website**: Upload the initial version of the website and configure the bucket for static website hosting.
4. **Update Website Content**: Make changes to the website and upload the updated version.
5. **Rollback to Previous Version**: Use S3â€™s versioning to roll back to a previous version of the website after making updates.

Key Features
- Static Website Hosting**: Utilized AWS S3 for fast and cost-effective static website hosting.
- Version Control**: Enabled versioning on the S3 bucket to keep track of all changes to the website files.
- Rollback Functionality**: Demonstrated how to roll back to a previous version of the website using S3's built-in versioning capabilities.

This project showcases practical knowledge in AWS S3 for hosting, version control, and managing updates and rollbacks, ensuring smooth deployment and maintenance of static websites.
